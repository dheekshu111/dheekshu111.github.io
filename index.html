      <p> First Year at Drexel University, Computer Science major at the College of Computing and Informatics. I am very
        dedicated to tackling complex analytical challenges. I have intermediate experience in both Python and Java. I
        also have a little experience in various other coding languages which include, C++, C#, and JavaScript.
        I am committed to honing skills, building relationships, and gaining confidence to excel in addressing
        multifaceted problems.
        <br> <br>
        I am engaged in a student organization, Techserv, dedicated to narrowing the digital gap in Philadelphia by
        refurbishing aging computers, and subsequently donating to non-profit organizations or individuals in need. This
        involvement facilitated an in-depth exploration of computers' technical facets, delving into both software and
        hardware components, thereby enriching my understanding of computing systems.
        <br> <br>
        I am also part of the Women in Computing Society. A student organization that primarily supports women in the
        field of computing and
        informatics. I am able to connect with other members through mentorship programs, social gatherings, guest
        speakers, workshops, and
        national and regional conferences. It is also a wonderful place to build meaningful relationships with people
        from different communities and backgrounds, but have computing in common.
